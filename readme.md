Dumping answers to question regarding what is webGlRenderTarget:


Q1. Can you explain me in simple terms what render target is and how it works and also the flow of how it works with the WHY being answered
Ans. 
Certainly! I'll explain render targets in simple terms, including how they work and why they're used.
What is a Render Target?
A render target is like a virtual canvas. Instead of drawing directly to your screen, you're drawing to this separate, invisible canvas.
How it Works:
1 Creation: Imagine you have a blank piece of paper (the render target).
2 Drawing: Instead of drawing on your main canvas (screen), you tell the computer to draw on this piece of paper.
3 Usage: After drawing, you can use this paper (now with a drawing on it) in various ways - like pasting it onto objects in your 3D scene.
The Flow:
1 Set up: Create your render target (blank paper).
2 Redirect: Tell the renderer to draw to this target instead of the screen.
3 Draw: Render your scene or objects.
4 Finish: Tell the renderer to go back to drawing on the screen.
5 Use: Now you have a texture (drawing) you can use elsewhere.

Why Use Render Targets?
Textures On-The-Fly:
You can create textures dynamically. For example, a mirror in a game - you render the reflection to a render target and use it as a texture on the mirror surface.
Multi-Step Effects:
Some visual effects require multiple drawing steps. Render targets let you do one step, then use that result in the next step.
Off-Screen Rendering:
You might need to render something without showing it immediately - like pre-calculating shadows.
Performance:
Sometimes it's faster to render something once to a texture, then reuse that texture, rather than re-rendering complex scenes repeatedly.
Resolution Control:7 
You can render at different resolutions for different purposes - like lower resolution for reflections to save performance.






Q2. Now in the same manner also explain how Render target works in threejs ?
ANS:
Now, let's dive into how render targets work specifically in Three.js, keeping the same approachable style.
Render Targets in Three.js:

1. Creation:
    In Three.js, you create a render target like this:
    `const renderTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(800, 600);`
    This is like getting a new, blank canvas of 800x600 pixels.

2. Using the Render Target:
    To draw to this "canvas", you use:  
    `renderer.setRenderTarget(renderTarget);`
    `renderer.render(scene, camera);`
    This tells Three.js: "Hey, draw on this special canvas, not the screen!"

3. Back to Normal:
    After you're done, you say:
    `renderer.setRenderTarget(null);`
    This is like telling Three.js: "Okay, you can draw on the screen again."

4. Using the Result:
    The cool part is, you can now use this as a texture:
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: renderTarget.texture });
    It's like taking your drawing and plastering it on a 3D object!

Flow in Three.js:

Setup: Create your WebGLRenderTarget.
Render: Point Three.js to your render target and draw your scene.
Reset: Tell Three.js to draw to the screen again.
Use: Apply the render target's texture to materials, or use in shaders.

Real-world Three.js Example:
Let's say you want to create a magic mirror:
        ```// Create a render target for the mirror
        const mirrorTarget = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(1024, 1024);

        // In your render loop:
        function render() {
            // 1. Render the reflection
            mirrorCamera.position.copy(mirror.position);
            mirrorCamera.lookAt(scene.position);
            renderer.setRenderTarget(mirrorTarget);
            renderer.render(scene, mirrorCamera);

            // 2. Use the reflection
            mirror.material.map = mirrorTarget.texture;

            // 3. Render the main scene
            renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
            renderer.render(scene, camera);

            requestAnimationFrame(render);
        }```







Q. Wonderful! But i have a doubt, you say that we can reuse the textures multiple times right once rendered!! But here in the code i can see that the renderer does render the target on every frame!! And also explain how render target is different from our renderer ?? I am confused as i can see we use our renderer to setRenderTarget to our screen then we render the scene on the screen and then we move ahead with rendering the main canvas!! So cant we use the same approach without using renderTarget ??? Like create a plane use renderer.setrendertarget(cameraFeed) and then render everyting one by one just like we are doing it right now ?
// Render security camera view to target renderer.setRenderTarget(cameraFeedTarget); renderer.render(scene, securityCamera);

ANS:
Excellent questions! You've touched on some important nuances. Let's clarify these points:

1. Rendering Every Frame
    You're absolutely right - in the example, we are rendering to the render target every frame. This was a simplified example for clarity. In practice, you might not need to do this every 
    frame, especially if the scene doesn't change. Here's how you could optimize it:
        ```let cameraViewNeedsUpdate = true;
        function render() {
            if (cameraViewNeedsUpdate) {
                renderer.setRenderTarget(cameraFeedTarget);
                renderer.render(scene, securityCamera);
                cameraViewNeedsUpdate = false;
            }

            renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
            renderer.render(scene, mainCamera);

            requestAnimationFrame(render);
        }

        // Set this to true whenever the security camera view needs updating
        function updateCameraView() {
            cameraViewNeedsUpdate = true;
        }```

2. Render Target vs. Renderer
The renderer is the tool that does the actual drawing. The render target is the surface it draws on. Think of the renderer as the paintbrush, and the render target as the canvas.

3. Why Not Just Use the Renderer Directly?
The key difference is that a render target creates a texture that persists and can be reused. When you render directly to the screen:
It's immediately displayed and then gone.
You can't manipulate it further.
You can't use it as a texture on other objects.

Let's illustrate the difference:
1. Without Render Target:
    function render() {
        // Render security camera view
        renderer.setViewport(0, 0, 256, 256);
        renderer.render(scene, securityCamera);

        // Render main scene
        renderer.setViewport(0, 0, window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
        renderer.render(scene, mainCamera);
    }
    Issues with this approach:
        You're limited to rendering the camera view in a specific part of the screen.
        You can't apply the camera view to 3D objects in your scene.
        You have to render both views every frame, even if one doesn't change.

2. With Render Target:
    function render() {
        // Render security camera view to texture
        renderer.setRenderTarget(cameraFeedTarget);
        renderer.render(scene, securityCamera);
        
        // Use the texture in the main scene
        screenMaterial.map = cameraFeedTarget.texture;
        
        // Render main scene (including screens showing camera feed)
        renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
        renderer.render(scene, mainCamera);
    }
    Advantages:
    The camera view is now a texture you can apply to any 3D object.
    You could render multiple screens showing the same camera feed without re-rendering.
    You can post-process the camera feed (add effects, etc.) before using it.
