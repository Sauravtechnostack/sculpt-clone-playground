Imagine you're doing collision detection between a large sphere (like an explosion radius) and many objects represented by bounding boxes:

If a box is NOT_INTERSECTED, you ignore it completely.
If a box is INTERSECTED, you might need to do more detailed collision checks with the actual object geometry.
If a box is CONTAINED, you know the entire object is affected without needing any further checks.




// Local to World and World to local transformation:
Local to World: Transforming from local to world coordinates allows us to understand and manipulate the block's position and orientation within the entire 3D scene. This step is essential when the block's transformations depend on the global context or interactions with other objects.

World to Local: Converting back to local coordinates ensures that the block's own transformations (like further movements or rotations) can be applied correctly and consistently. This step maintains the integrity of the block's local transformations, making sure that its internal structure is preserved while allowing for complex scene-wide adjustments.
