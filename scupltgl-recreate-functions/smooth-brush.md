Absolutely! Let's break this down step-by-step with a more visual example. Imagine you're painting on a 3D sphere, and we'll go through 30 render frames to see what's happening.

Frame 1-5: Mouse Press
- User presses the mouse button at position (100, 100).
- The brush appears on the 3D sphere at the corresponding point.

Frame 6-10: Initial Mouse Movement
- Mouse moves quickly to (300, 300).
- The code calculates:
  mdx = (300 - 100) * screenWidth * pixelRatio
  mdy = (300 - 100) * screenHeight * pixelRatio
  mdist = sqrt(mdx^2 + mdy^2) // Let's say this is 400 pixels

Frame 11: Stroke Calculation Begins
- step = brushSize * 0.15 // Let's say this is 10 pixels
- percent = max(10 / 400, 1 / maxSteps) // Let's say this is 0.025
- mstep = 400 * 0.025 = 10 pixels

Frame 12-29: Stroke Application Loop
Each frame in this range will:
1. Update brush position:
   - Frame 12: (105, 105)
   - Frame 13: (110, 110)
   - ...
   - Frame 29: (295, 295)

2. Apply paint at each position
3. Reduce remaining distance:
   - castDist starts at 400, reduces by 10 each frame
   - mdist starts at 400, reduces by 10 each frame

Visualization per frame:
- Frame 12: Small dot at (105, 105)
- Frame 13: Line from (105, 105) to (110, 110)
- Frame 14: Line extends to (115, 115)
- ...
- Frame 29: Line nearly reaches (300, 300)

Frame 30: Finalizing Stroke
- Brush reaches final position (300, 300)
- Complete line from (100, 100) to (300, 300) is visible on the 3D sphere

Throughout this process:
- The brush on screen smoothly moves from start to end.
- On the 3D sphere, a continuous line is drawn, following the surface contours.

Example with numbers:
Let's say brushSize is 50 pixels.
- step = 50 * 0.15 = 7.5 pixels
- For a 400-pixel move, we'll have about 53 small steps (400 / 7.5)

Each small step:
1. Moves the brush a tiny bit (7.5 pixels) along the path
2. Applies paint at that position
3. Ensures no gaps in the paint, even for fast mouse movements

This system allows for smooth, continuous painting on the 3D surface, translating a 2D mouse movement into a 3D paint stroke, regardless of how fast the user moves the mouse.







// Soo what this while loop along with step is doing is for smooth mouse move! Consider if mouse between two frames move too quickly then consider we are painting then paint will only be applied on every frame. This is fine if we are moving slow, but if we move faster then the frames are being render then we wont be able to paint thus what we do is keep a step size and on every frame we get the last mouse position and current mouse position and go through a while loop while the distance between the two far away points is reduced while we perform the stoke for every step and keep reducing that difference and we do this every frame.
